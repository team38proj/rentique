		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<h3>Welcome to Rentique</h3>
	
		
		<p>Rentique: Project Dakar
		
		<br> 
		<br>
		At Rentique we hold the belief that style must not be sacrificed at the cost of our environment or society. Located in Dakar, Senegal, among one 
of the globe’s most contaminated urban areas. Our goal is to combat the ecological damage inflicted by fast fashion by providing an eco-friendly 
option. 
<br>
<br>
Rentique is an fashion rental service aimed at minimizing waste by prolonging the durability of clothes and providing access, to premium 
fashion for all. Rather than purchasing clothes for single use, clients have the option to rent items and then return them with ease. Rentique 
handles everything, from shipping to expert cleaning, ensuring fashion is hassle-free.Our website offers a range of designer clothes, vintage finds,
standout accessories and footwear. Through category filters and tailored user profiles, Rentique simplifies the process of dressing stylishly while
 supporting ethical decisions. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Fast fashion is responsible, for 8–10% of carbon emissions and Dakar experiences this effect firsthand. As Group 38 
 we chose the name Rentique to honor Dakar's pollution status and emphasize our dedication to helping resolve the issue. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Moreover our efforts extend beyond sustainability.
To support communities impacted by damage Rentique contributes 5% of all earnings to organizations that help to minimize waste and enhance social 
welfare. Each rental not only lessens fashion waste but also contributes to beneficial transformation in Dakar.
